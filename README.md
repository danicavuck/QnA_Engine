# Machine Learning Q&A Engine with LSTM and Nearest Neighbor

1. __High Recall model - NN__
2. __High Precision model - LSTM__

This project combines the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and nearest neighbor search for creating a robust Question and Answer (Q&A) engine. The LSTM model understands the context of questions, while the nearest neighbor search enhances response generation based on similarity.

## Features

- **LSTM Model:** Utilizes LSTM networks for sequence learning, enhancing the understanding of question context.

- **Nearest Neighbor Search:** Incorporates nearest neighbor search to find responses similar to the input question.

- **Training Pipeline:** Easily train and retrain the LSTM model with your own dataset using the provided training pipeline.

## Prerequisites
